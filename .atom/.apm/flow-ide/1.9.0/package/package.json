It's pretty lightweight and robust.\n\n#### Installation\n```\napm install flow-ide\n```\n\n#### Features\n\n - Linting\n - Autocomplete\n - Jump to declaration (using [facebook-atom/hyperclick][hyperclick] or [facebook-atom/atom-ide-ui][atom-ide-ui])\n - Datatip on hover (using [facebook-atom/atom-ide-ui][atom-ide-ui])\n\n#### Roadmap\n\n - Show types on mouseover\n\n#### Differences to other packages\n\nDifferences to [facebook/nuclide][nuclide]\n - Nuclide is nice and all but it's mostly bloatware for lightweight flow programming\n\nDifferences to [AtomLinter/linter-flow][linter-flow]\n - It tries to manage flow servers by itself, I find it annoying\n\nDifferences to [nmn/autocomplete-flow][autocomplete-flow]\n - Never worked for me\n\nDifferences to [LukeHoban/ide-flow][ide-flow]\n - Outdated and buggy\n - No longer maintained\n\n#### Screenshots\n\n![Autocomplete](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4278113/12857027/bb8e2c80-cc69-11e5-918d-4451d0679e66.png)\n\n\n#### License\n\nThis project is licensed under the terms of MIT License.
