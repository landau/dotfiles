Due to the syntax highlighting library they use on the site, there are some minor inconsistencies but those felt more like edge cases (and Atom actually handles it better than Pygments does in those cases). I compared syntax highlighting on 5 or 6 major languages and by the last one I hardly saw any differences, so I feel pretty good about this. If you find some differences you'd like fixed, go ahead and try to get it working locally and cut a PR here.\n\nSee screenshots of some common languages below.\n\n### HTML:\n![screenshot](https://raw.github.com/mmcbride1007/github-2016-syntax/master/media/github-syntax-html-screenshot.png)\n\n### JavaScript:\n![screenshot](https://raw.github.com/mmcbride1007/github-2016-syntax/master/media/github-syntax-js-screenshot.png)\n\n### CSS:\n![screenshot](https://raw.github.com/mmcbride1007/github-2016-syntax/master/media/github-syntax-css-screenshot.png)\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/mmcbride1007/github-2016-syntax/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/mmcbride1007/github-2016-syntax#readme","_id":"github-2016-syntax@1.2.0","_shasum":"a78c2ba39e28b9634fb6bc3ffa626d8f85a884b5","_resolved":"file:../d-116211-42947-uz4bzs/package.tgz","_from":"../d-116211-42947-uz4bzs/package.tgz"}
