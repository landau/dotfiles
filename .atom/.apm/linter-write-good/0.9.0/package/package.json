See\n[write-good](https://github.com/btford/write-good) for possible arguments to the\ncommand.\n\nMoreover, you can set the **severity level** of this linter. The default level\nis **Error**. Setting the severity level to **Warning** or **Info** helps\ndistinguish *write-good* highlighting from the highlighting of an ordinary spell\nchecker, or higher priority linters.\n\n### Note: Additional Linting\n\n#### E-Prime\n\nThe Write-Good library implements a linter for\n[E-Prime](https://github.com/btford/write-good/issues/70) which is off by\ndefault. To enable E-Prime linting, you'll need to add the `--yes-eprime` flag\nto the extra arguments input under this package's settings page.\n\n![](https://raw.github.com/gepoch/linter-write-good/master/flags.png)\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/gepoch/linter-write-good/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/gepoch/linter-write-good#readme","_id":"linter-write-good@0.9.0","_shasum":"afe974d4391d0d37589c915d9c66ce2976b80fc5","_resolved":"file:../d-117231-61618-1l15tx/package.tgz","_from":"../d-117231-61618-1l15tx/package.tgz"}
