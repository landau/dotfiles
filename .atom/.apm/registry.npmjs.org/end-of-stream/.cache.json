end-of-stream\n\nA node module that calls a callback when a readable/writable/duplex stream has completed or failed.\n\n\tnpm install end-of-stream\n\n## Usage\n\nSimply pass a stream and a callback to the `eos`.\nBoth legacy streams, streams2 and stream3 are supported.\n\n``` js\nvar eos = require('end-of-stream');\n\neos(readableStream, function(err) {\n  // this will be set to the stream instance\n\tif (err) return console.log('stream had an error or closed early');\n\tconsole.log('stream has ended', this === readableStream);\n});\n\neos(writableStream, function(err) {\n\tif (err) return console.log('stream had an error or closed early');\n\tconsole.log('stream has finished', this === writableStream);\n});\n\neos(duplexStream, function(err) {\n\tif (err) return console.log('stream had an error or closed early');\n\tconsole.log('stream has ended and finished', this === duplexStream);\n});\n\neos(duplexStream, {readable:false}, function(err) {\n\tif (err) return console.log('stream had an error or closed early');\n\tconsole.log('stream has finished but might still be readable');\n});\n\neos(duplexStream, {writable:false}, function(err) {\n\tif (err) return console.log('stream had an error or closed early');\n\tconsole.log('stream has ended but might still be writable');\n});\n\neos(readableStream, {error:false}, function(err) {\n\t// do not treat emit('error', err) as a end-of-stream\n});\n```\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\n## Related\n\n`end-of-stream` is part of the [mississippi stream utility collection](https://github.com/maxogden/mississippi) which includes more useful stream modules similar to this one.\n","maintainers":[{"name":"mafintosh","email":"mathiasbuus@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2017-07-28T10:12:08.976Z","created":"2013-11-26T23:28:55.601Z","0.1.0":"2013-11-26T23:28:59.564Z","0.1.1":"2013-11-27T01:05:45.555Z","0.1.2":"2013-11-27T01:16:00.613Z","0.1.3":"2013-12-19T10:41:25.227Z","0.1.4":"2014-02-18T10:17:56.792Z","0.1.5":"2014-06-29T07:03:54.107Z","1.0.0":"2014-07-21T11:04:32.385Z","1.1.0":"2014-09-07T18:21:10.694Z","1.2.0":"2017-03-10T16:01:28.737Z","1.3.0":"2017-03-14T09:55:55.621Z","1.4.0":"2017-03-14T10:40:44.044Z"},"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/mafintosh/end-of-stream.git"},"readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"timhudson":true,"forivall":true,"substack":true,"nichoth":true,"burl.bn":true,"incendiary":true,"stringparser":true,"klyngbaek":true,"amobiz":true,"dralc":true,"juangotama":true,"seangenabe":true,"akiva":true,"mreinstein":true,"panlw":true},"homepage":"https://github.com/mafintosh/end-of-stream","keywords":["stream","streams","callback","finish","close","end","wait"],"author":{"name":"Mathias
