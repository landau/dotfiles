It also, for the time being, automatically downloads and manages any missing flow binaries, though this probably is best suited to each individual editor integration.\n\n## Building an editor integration\nIf your editor integration is built with node.js, you can install `flow-language-server` as a dependency:\n* `yarn add flow-language-server` or\n* `npm install -S flow-language-server`\n\nOtherwise, `flow-language-server` can be installed globally from npm into the user's path:\n* `yarn global add flow-language-server` or\n* `npm install -g flow-language-server`\n\n## Editor Integrations\n\n### [Flow for Atom IDE (ide-flow)](https://github.com/flowtype/ide-flow/)\nDeveloped in conjunction with flow-language-server, Flow for Atom IDE showcases all that the language server has to offer. Install it as `ide-flow` through Atom's package manager along with `atom-ide-ui`.\n\n### Neovim\n`flow-language-server` can be used with neovim:\n1. Install [LanguageClient-neovim](https://github.com/autozimu/LanguageClient-neovim)\n2. Run `npm install -g flow-language-server` or `yarn global add flow-language-server`\n3. Add the following to neovim's configuration:\n\n```\nlet g:LanguageClient_serverCommands = {\n\\ 'javascript': ['flow-language-server', '--stdio'],\n\\ }\n\n\" (Optionally) automatically start language servers.\nlet g:LanguageClient_autoStart = 1\n```\n\n### Wrote your own editor integration using `flow-language-server`?
