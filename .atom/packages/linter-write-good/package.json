See\n[write-good](https://github.com/btford/write-good) for possible arguments to the\ncommand.\n\nMoreover, you can set the **severity level** of this linter. The default level\nis **Error**. Setting the severity level to **Warning** or **Info** helps\ndistinguish *write-good* highlighting from the highlighting of an ordinary spell\nchecker, or higher priority linters.\n\n### Note: Additional Linting\n\n#### E-Prime\n\nThe Write-Good library implements a linter for\n[E-Prime](https://github.com/btford/write-good/issues/70) which is off by\ndefault. To enable E-Prime linting, you'll need to add the `--yes-eprime` flag\nto the extra arguments input under this package's settings page.\n\n![](https://raw.github.com/gepoch/linter-write-good/master/flags.png)\n",
